# coupon-system-jbh-project-core
This is the first part of my final project of Java course @ John Bryce School

This part requires the JDBC Derby jars to connect to the database.
The credentials for the connection profile are

**url**: jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/CouponSystem

**user**: root

**password**: root


These credentials can also be found in /src/com/jbh/utils/ConnectionPool.java.
