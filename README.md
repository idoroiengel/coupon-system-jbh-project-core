# Coupon System - Final Project - Part I

This is the first part of my final project of Java course @ John Bryce School

This project requires the JDBC Derby jars to connect to the database. The credentials for the connection profile are

**url**: jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/CouponSystem

**user**: root

**password**: root

These credentials can also be found in /src/com/jbh/utils/ConnectionPool.java.

The manipulating commands for the tables of the project's database can be found in /manipulating-tables-script
